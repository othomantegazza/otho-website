title: Otho - About
---

<p>
	I am Otho, <br>
	I am a plant biologist, I am interested in genetics, data analysis and
	methods for making research easier and more accessible, such as open source
	software and hardware. <br>
	I am a postdoc at <a href="http://ceplas.eu">CEPLAS</a>. <br>
	Opinions here are my own.
</p>

<p>
	This website was modeled on what I learned from
	<a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">here</a> (and I am very greatful
	for this short guide)
	As you can see, I am not an expert in HTML and CSS, but I am slowly improving :)
