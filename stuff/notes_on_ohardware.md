title: "A Collection of Resources for Open Hardware in Biology"

This is a collection of websites that I am keeping track of in order to get an
overview of the current state of open hardware in biology.

I'll try to update this list regularly.

## Opentrons

[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/) is an open source/hardware robot. Its
hardware, software and scripts for protocols are tracked on
[Github](https://github.com/OpenTrons).

## GaudiLabs

[GaudiLabs](http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/) are open labs.
Their website contains a detailed list of
[Open Hardware projects for lab equipment](http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=19),
including cool stuff such as the [OpenDrop](http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/).

## Open hardware microfluidics

The [StreyLab](http://streylab.com/) developed an Open Hardware Microfluidic
Controller, which is documented on their
[Github page](https://github.com/hstrey) and on [their blog](http://streylab.com/blog/2015/4/8/open-hardware-microfluidics-controller-arduino-shield).

## Manu Prakash lab

The [Manu Prakash lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab/cgi-bin/labsite/) is home of impressive frugal science.

They develop tools such as:

- A [folding microscope](https://www.foldscope.com/),
- A [punchcard microfuidic device](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4874),
- A [citizen mosquito surveillance ](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/25/120519),
- And the [paperfuge](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/30/072207).

Looks like the last two elements haven't gone through peer review yet.

## Bio Academany

[Bio Academany](http://bio.academany.org/) hosts a distributed course on
synthetic biology; it is expensive, (at 5000$ / year ?), but provides hands on time through Fablabs (?).
The [classes](https://vimeo.com/fabacademy) are hosted on Vimeo, and the website contain [info on open hardware for biology](http://bio.academany.org/doc/tool_chains).


## Hackteria

The [Hacteria](http://www.hackteria.org/) DIY Bio community.

## Generics

- [Open Hardware Science](http://openhardware.science/)
- [Open Source hardware association](https://www.oshwa.org/)

## Others

- [Lego based liquid handling robot](https://youtu.be/f6yltxZg8Rw) :)
- [Open raman spectrometer](https://gitlab.com/ramanPi) on gitlab; more on the
chemistry side,
- Search `biology` on [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/) to get a constant feed of
new projects.


## Bonus ;)
<https://youtu.be/SGJ5cZnoodY> - A Wired UK documentary on open
hardware development in the city of Shenzhen.
