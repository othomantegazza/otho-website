Recently the [TidyTuesday social project proposed a dataset documenting R&D spending of the US government](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-12). This dataset was originally collected by the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://www.aaas.org/).

This tidy dataset stores R&D spending by the US government from 1976 to 2016, devided by agency. It's available [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-12).

# Load Packages and Download Files

Let's explore this dataset. 

First we load the packages that we need.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tibbletime)
```

And then the data.

<button class="collapsible">Show code</button>
```{r}
# Get data ---------------------------------------------------

rd_path <- "_data/2-07-funding.Rdata"
rd_url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/",
                 "rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/",
                 "2019/2019-02-12/fed_r_d_spending.csv")

if(!file.exists(rd_path)) {
  rd <- 
    read_csv(rd_url)
  
  save(rd, file = rd_path)
  
} else {
  load(rd_path)
}
```

The `rd` dataset has this aspect.

```{r}
rd %>% print()
```

# Explore - Do Funding Patterns Hint to Policies?

Yes, they do. But to go more in detail: Which agencies get similar fundings? Do funding to certain groups of research agencies correlate? And what could we learn from that?

## Correlation between funding pattern

The was one of the first things that I explored, and I got lucky. It seems that there are two groups of correlation. 

First we must switch to the wide data format, because it is easier to test correlation if we have each variable in its own column.

```{r}
# Long format
rd_wide <- 
  rd %>% 
  select(department, year, rd_budget) %>% 
  tidyr::spread(key = department,
                value = rd_budget)

# correlation of everything against everything
rd_wide %>%
  column_to_rownames("year") %>% 
  GGally::ggcorr() 
```

This is very lucky, it looks like there are two defined groups of correlation. Could we capture this behaviour in clusters?

## Clusters of funding patterns?

When clustering, we generally want to capture pattern of behaviour of our variables. Meaning that we want to capture how one variable behaves compared to another, when one variable increases in value, doed the other do the same? 

So, to make our variables comparable, we must scale them. 

Probably, the most common scaling is by z-scores. But this introduce negative numbers. Since we are talking about fundings, negative fundings could be a bit unusual. 

Thus I decided to scale fundings for each agency between 0 and 1, in this way we can make them comparable and present them in a more intuitive way.

```{r}
# scale each variable between 0 and 1
rd_wide_01 <- 
  rd_wide %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-contains("year")), ~scales::rescale(., to = c(0,1)))


# this is how it looks after scaling
rd_wide_01 %>% print()
```

After scaling, we can try hierachical clustering first.

```{r}
# For clustering
# we need to transpose the data
# because dist() %>% clusters the columns
rd_for_clust <-   
  rd_wide_01 %>%
  column_to_rownames("year") %>%
  t() 

rd_hclust <-
  rd_for_clust %>% 
  dist() %>%
  hclust() 
```

And check that two groups of agencies with different funding patterns.

```{r}
rd_hclust %>% plot()
```

Does the k-means algorithm provide similar results?

```{r}
# ordered factor

# kmeans
k_clust <- 
  rd_for_clust %>%
  # Try to replicate 2 clusters
  kmeans(centers = 2)

# Some tidying to check the clusters
clust_df <- 
  k_clust$cluster %>% 
  {tibble(department = names(.),
          cluster = .)}
```

Ok, this is what we expect from previous results, but how do we visualize the clusters? This is a visualization that is used often in biology:

```{r}

# First we can provide descriptive department name
depts <- c(
  DOD = "Deparment of Defense",
  NASA = "National Aeronautics and Space Administration",
  DOE = "Department of Energy",
  HHS = "Department of Health and Human Services",
  NIH = "National Institute of Health",
  NSF = "National Science Foundation",
  USDA = "US Department of Agriculture",
  Interior = "Department of Interior",
  DOT = "Deparment of Transportation",
  EPA = "Environmental Protection Agency",
  DOC = "Department of Corrections",
  DHS = "Department of Homeland Security",
  VA = "Department of Veterands Affairs",
  Other = "other R&D spending")

# cl_depts <- 
#   clust_tidy %>% 
#   mutate(full_name = depts[agency %>% as.character()] %>% unname()) %>%
#   {split(.$full_name, .$cluster)} %>%
#   map(unique) %>% 
#   map_chr(~paste(., collapse = "\n"))
# 
#   
# # plot
# p <- 
#   clust_tidy %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = year %>% as.numeric(),
#              y = scaled_funding,
#              colour = cluster)) +
#   geom_line(aes(group = agency),
#             alpha = .5) +
#   stat_summary(aes(group = cluster),
#                geom = "line",
#                fun.y = median,
#                size = 2) +
#   facet_grid(cluster ~ .,
#              labeller = labeller(cluster = cl_depts)) +
#   scale_color_viridis_d(begin = .3, end = .8,
#                         option = "B", guide = FALSE) 
#   
```
