Hi, I am Otho,

I am a plant biologist interested in genetics, data analysis and
methods for making research easier and more accessible, such as open source
software and hardware.

This is my blog, indeed about biology, open source and anything under the sun. I haven't implemented a comment section yet. Please, if you notice any issue or typo, or if you have any suggestion feel free to send me an email at <othomanteotho@gmail.com> or a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/othomantegazza).

Sometimes I introduce small updates and fix small things in old posts. If for some wierd reason you are interested to a very specific version of a post you can check its modification history always on [Github](https://github.com/othomantegazza) (right now this blog is generated from the "blogdown" branch of the "othomantegazza.github.io" repo, I'll simplify this setup soon).

I am a postdoc at [CEPLAS](http://ceplas.eu/), opinions here are my own.

This blog is generated with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)
