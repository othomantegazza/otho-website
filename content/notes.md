title: "A Collection of Resources for Open Hardware in Biology"
---

This is a collection of websites that I am keeping track of in order to get an
overview of the current state of open hardware in biology.

I'll try to update this list regularly.

## Opentrons

[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/) is an open source/hardware robot. Its
hardware, software and scripts for protocols are tracked on
[Github](https://github.com/OpenTrons).

## GaudiLabs

[GaudiLabs](http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/) are open labs.
Their website contains a detailed list of
[Open Hardware projects for lab equipment](http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=19),
including cool stuff such as the [OpenDrop](http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/).

## Open hardware microfluidics

The [StreyLab](http://streylab.com/) developed an Open Hardware Microfluidic
Controller, which is documented on their
[Github page](https://github.com/hstrey) and on [their blog](http://streylab.com/blog/2015/4/8/open-hardware-microfluidics-controller-arduino-shield).

[Metafluidics](https://metafluidics.org/devices/) collects open source microfluidics projects for biology.

### Microfluidics PCR

Microfluidics can help to automate and scale down the volume of PCR and qPCR,
Open Hardware can have a great impact in this field.

Not Open Hardware, but Elveflow provides a nice overview of
[microfluidic PCR development](http://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-tutorials/microfluidic-reviews-and-tutorials/microfluidic-pcr-qpcr-rtpcr/).

And a [peer reviewed paper on the topic](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214753515000285)

## Manu Prakash lab

The [Manu Prakash lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab/cgi-bin/labsite/) is home of impressive frugal science.

They develop tools such as:

- A [folding microscope](https://www.foldscope.com/),
- A [punchcard microfuidic device](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4874),
- A [citizen mosquito surveillance ](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/25/120519),
- And the [paperfuge](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/30/072207).

Looks like the last two elements haven't gone through peer review yet.

## Bio Academany

[Bio Academany](http://bio.academany.org/) hosts a distributed course on
synthetic biology; it is expensive, (at 5000$ / year ?), but provides hands on time through Fablabs (?).
The [classes](https://vimeo.com/fabacademy) are hosted on Vimeo, and the website contain [info on open hardware for biology](http://bio.academany.org/doc/tool_chains).

## Open qPCR

[Chaibio](https://www.chaibio.com/) developed and is selling a [qPCR with open
source software and hardware](https://www.chaibio.com/openqpcr). They are also
developing the [Chai Green](https://www.chaibio.com/chai-green), a freely
licensed DNA binding dye.

## Farming

- The [Open Agriculture](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/) group at MIT and their [Github page](https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative).
- The mighty [FarmBot](https://farmbot.io/) and, again, its [Github page](https://github.com/farmbot)

## Hackteria

The [Hacteria](http://www.hackteria.org/) DIY Bio community.

## Generics

- [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/) more oriented toward environmental
 science, contains great project and inspiration.
- [Open Hardware Science](http://openhardware.science/)
- [Open Source hardware association](https://www.oshwa.org/)

## Others

- [Lego based liquid handling robot](https://youtu.be/f6yltxZg8Rw) :)
- [Open raman spectrometer](https://gitlab.com/ramanPi) on gitlab; more on the
chemistry side,
- Search `biology` on [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/) to get a constant feed of
new projects.


## Bonus ;)
<https://youtu.be/SGJ5cZnoodY> - A Wired UK documentary on open
hardware development in the city of Shenzhen.
