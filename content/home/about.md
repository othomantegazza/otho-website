Hi, I am Otho, I am a plant biologist.

My main scientific interests are genetics, and data analysis, including data visualization and statistcs.

Also, I am interested in methods to teach, publish and communicate science in a way that's easier and more inclusive. Indeed I strongly support the idea that generation and communication of knowledge are not independent from one another, but one single process.

This is my website and my blog, in here you'll find my CV, my projects and my posts. Feel free to access them, read and comment.

The sources for most of my projects and for this website are on [Github](https://github.com/othomantegazza). Please, if you notice any issue or typo, or if you have any suggetion pull requests are welcome.  This blog is generated with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
