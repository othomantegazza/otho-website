Hi, I am Otho, I am a plant biologist.

My main scientific skills are molecular genetics, and data analysis, including data visualization and statistics.

Also, I am interested in methods to teach, publish and communicate science in a way that's easier and more inclusive. Our scientific production can only gain if we open our results to communication and debate.

This is my website and my blog, in here you'll find my {{% staticref "CV/otho-mantegazza-cv.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}}, my projects and my posts. Feel free to access them, read and comment.
