      <description>Back To The Books Toward the end of my PhD I was struggling to learn new skills such as data analysis and programming; it was at that time that I (duh!) rediscovered books and, moreover, discovered a very special kind of books, known as open books or open source books. We might regard as open source books any book that is distributed on a permissive license, but there is much more.</description>

      <description>Can Open Source Hardware help fill the gap and bring technology within reach for everybody?
I am a biologist in academia. I am curious about how Open Source Hardware can improve the way we do research and the way in which we distribute our results and the technology that we produce.
Definitions first The Open Source Hardware Association defines Open Source Hardware as:
 “hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design”</description>

      <description>As a young scientist, I find myself facing these challenges (or, at least, let&amp;rsquo;s say that I am trying to improve in these areas):
 make research in an interdisciplinary and distributed context, maximize the chances that anybody can access and reproduce my results, engage with the wide public.  Learning these enabling tools are helping me dealing with this:
 A programming language, easier if it is a high level one such as R or Python.</description>
