      <description>Hi, I am Otho,
I am a plant biologist interested in genetics, data analysis and methods for making research easier and more accessible, such as open source software and hardware.
This is my blog, indeed about biology, open source and anything under the sun. I haven&amp;rsquo;t implemented a comment section yet. Please, if you notice any issue or typo, or if you have any suggestion feel free to send me an email at othomanteotho@gmail.</description>

      <description>Can Open Source Hardware help fill the gap and bring technology within reach for everybody?
I am a biologist in academia. I am curious about how Open Source Hardware can improve the way we do research and the way in which we distribute our results and the technology that we produce.
Definitions first The Open Source Hardware Association defines Open Source Hardware as:
 “hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design”</description>

      <description>As a young scientist, I find myself facing these challenges (or, at least, let&amp;rsquo;s say that I am trying to improve in these areas):
 make research in an interdisciplinary and distributed context, maximize the chances that anybody can access and reproduce my results, engage with the wide public.  Learning these enabling tools are helping me dealing with this:
 A programming language, easier if it is a high level one such as R or Python.</description>

      <title>A Collection of Resources for Open Hardware in Biology</title>

      <description>This is a collection of websites that I am keeping track of in order to get an overview of the current state of open hardware in biology.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to update this list regularly.
Opentrons Opentrons is an open source/hardware robot. Its hardware, software and scripts for protocols are tracked on Github.
GaudiLabs GaudiLabs are open labs. Their website contains a detailed list of Open Hardware projects for lab equipment, including cool stuff such as the OpenDrop.</description>
